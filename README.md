LifeSequenceHMM: Hidden Markov Models for Life Sequences and Other Multivariate, Multichannel Categorical Time Series
====================================================================================================

LifeSequenceHMM is an R package with focus on fast algorithms for estimation and inference of 
discrete hidden Markov models with multichannel and multivariate observations such as life sequence data.

Package is still in testing phase, but will be available in CRAN later in 2014.
