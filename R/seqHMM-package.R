#' seqHMM
#' 
#' The seqHMM package is designed for fitting hidden (or latent) Markov models (HMMs) and 
#' mixture hidden Markov models (MHMMs) for social sequence data and other categorical 
#' time series. The package supports models for one or multiple subjects with one or 
#' multiple interdependent sequences (channels). External covariates can be added to 
#' explain cluster membership in MHMMs. The package provides functions for evaluating 
#' and comparing models, as well as functions for easy plotting of multichannel sequences 
#' and hidden Markov models.
#' 
#' Maximum likelihood estimation via EM algorithm and direct numerical maximization 
#' with analytical gradients is supported. All main algorithms are written in C++.
