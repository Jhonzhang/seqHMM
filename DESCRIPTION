Description: Package seqHMM is designed for inference of hidden Markov models
    where both the hidden state space and the symbol space of observations is
    discrete, and observations consists of multiple sequences possibly with
    multiply channels such as life calendar data with multiple life domains.
    Maximum likelihood estimation via direct numerical maximization with 
    analytical gradients and EM algorithm is supported. All main algorithms 
    are written in C++.
