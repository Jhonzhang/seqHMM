Description: Package seqHMM is designed for inference of hidden Markov
    models where both the hidden state space and the symbol space of
    observations is discrete, and observations consists of multiple sequences
    as channels such as life calendar data with multiple life domains.
    seqHMM supports maximum likelihood estimation of hidden Markov
    models via numerical optimization routines. Main functions of
    seqHMM are written in Fortran for improved performance.
