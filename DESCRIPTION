Description: Package seqHMM is designed for inference of mixture hidden Markov models 
    and their restricted variants where both the hidden state space and the symbol 
    space of observations is discrete, and observations consists of multiple 
    sequences possibly with multiple channels such as life calendar data with 
    multiple life domains. Maximum likelihood estimation via EM algorithm and 
    direct numerical maximization with analytical gradients is supported. 
    All main algorithms are written in C++.
