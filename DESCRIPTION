Description: Package MVHMM is designed for inference of hidden Markov models
    where both the hidden state space and the symbol space of observations is
    discrete. MVHMM supports maximum likelihood estimation of hidden Markov
    models when multiple observation sequences are available. Currently only
    numerical maximization is supported. Main functions of MVHMM are written in
    Fortran 95.
