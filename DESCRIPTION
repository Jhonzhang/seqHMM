Description: Package seqHMM is designed for inference of hidden Markov models
    where both the hidden state space and the symbol space of observations is
    discrete, and observations consists of multiple sequences possibly with
    multiply channels such as life calendar data with multiple life domains.
    Maximum likelihood estimation via EM algorithm and direct numerical
    maximization with analytical gradients is supported. All main algorithms
    are written in C++.
